latino-latinx
=============
There is an ongoing debate about which term to use to refer to people with Latin-American heritage. The options for collectively referring to this group include the ethnonyms "Hispanic" and "Latino". "Latinx" is also used and is gaining popularity, though it is not without its own linguistic controversy. 

 This Chrome extension lets the user pick one ethnonym to be used around the web. The user will no longer see the other two terms because their term of choice will have replaced them. 

Known limitations of this extension:
- Conversions to "Latino" do not include gendered conversions to "Latina".
